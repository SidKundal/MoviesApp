# MoviesApp

This app uses the OMDB API (http://www.omdbapi.com/) to allow the user to search for movies by title.

How to Run:
Install the .apk file (placed in the root folder of the repo) in your mobile phone and run the application.

A very big thanks to Brian Fritz for providing a free API key to access the API.
